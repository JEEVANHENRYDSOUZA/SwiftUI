# ðŸ”‘ Swift KeyPaths Guide

KeyPaths in Swift are powerful tools that allow you to **reference properties** of a type without accessing them directly. Introduced in Swift 4, KeyPaths enable **type-safe, flexible, and reusable code** â€” especially in SwiftUI and Combine.

## ðŸ“š What is a KeyPath?

A `KeyPath` is a type-safe, compiler-checked reference to a property.

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}

let nameKeyPath = \Person.name // KeyPath<Person, String>
let john = Person(name: "John", age: 30)
print(john[keyPath: nameKeyPath]) // Prints: John
As long as the property is not computed or static property we can use keypath
